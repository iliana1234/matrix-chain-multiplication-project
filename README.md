# matrix-chain-multiplication-project

A **Matrix Chain Multiplication** application developed in **Qt Creator**.  
It processes matrices from user input or .txt files and computes the result, optimal parenthesization, split points, and solution reconstruction. Users can also save matrix inputs to a file.

## Features
- Input matrices manually or through .txt files.
- Compute the result of the multiplication of the chain of matrices.
- Shows the **optimal parenthesization** for minimum multiplication cost.
- Shows **split points** and the **solution reconstruction**.
- Option to save matrix inputs to a .txt file for later use.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iliana1234/matrix-chain-multiplication-project.git
